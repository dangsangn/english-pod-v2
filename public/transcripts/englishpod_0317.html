        <div class="text">Hey, Susan. Have you got a sec? I have some questions about my paycheck.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">Susan</div>
        <div class="text">You bet, Emily. Pull up a chair.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">Emily</div>
        <div class="text">Well, this is my first paycheck here inthe States and there are a few things I don’t understand. First off, what is this FICA, and SUI Y tax, and why are there deductions both for Medicare and for my health insurance plan?</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">Susan</div>
        <div class="text">OK, let’s start from the top of your pay stub. This number here represents your gross pay.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">Emily</div>
        <div class="text">Yes, that’s easy enough to understand.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">Susan</div>
        <div class="text">Then here we have a series of deductions. First off are the federal ones. FICA stands for Federal Insurance Contribution Act, or something like that. It’s your federal income tax. And then there’s Social Security and Medicare, which are both federal programs to help you out after you retire or if you were unable to work.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">Emily</div>
        <div class="text">All right, I see. So the Medicare isn’t actually a health insurance I can use now.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">Susan</div>
        <div class="text">That’s right. Below the federal deductions are the state deductions. There’s the state income tax, and then this SUI SDItax you were asking about is paying into an unemployment and disability fund that our state has set up, but you can see it’s a pretty small quantity that they take.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">Emily</div>
        <div class="text">Yeah, I don’t mind giving them a dollar fifty for that. So there are two separate income taxes – one at a state level and one at a federal level?</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">Susan</div>
        <div class="text">That’s right. Not all states have an income tax. Some use higher property taxes or sales taxes instead.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">Emily</div>
        <div class="text">I see. All right, well I think everything else I can figure out on my own. The deductions for health insurance and my 401(K) are pretty self-explanatory. Thanks for your help, Susan.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">Susan</div>
        <div class="text">No problem! All those deductions do add up, and nobody’s net pay is as high as they’d like. I can understand why you’d want some explanation.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">Emily</div>
        <div class="text">Yeah, I guess it’s the same in the UK, I just never paid much attention. See you later!</div>
