        <div class="text">Hey Mel! Are you up for some tennis today?</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">Mel</div>
        <div class="text">Sorry, I can’t! I have to go to work,  pick up Jake and Maddie from school, and make them an afternoon snack, then take Jake to soccer practice and Maddie to dance class.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">Grace</div>
        <div class="text">You sound exhausted. Maybe you should hire a nanny to help you out! She can pick the kids up and take them to their after-school activities. She can also help you do some household chores, and run some errands.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">Mel</div>
        <div class="text">Oh, I don't know... it's hard to find the right nanny .You have to consider her previous work experience, the responsibilities you give her, and how she interacts with the kids. I would love to have someone to help me out, though.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">Grace</div>
        <div class="text">I think you should definitely consider it! This way you won’t have to juggle such a busy schedule, and you’ll still get to spend time with the kids in the evenings. I can refer you this great nanny Amy. She used to work for my neighbors, before they moved away. She’s very responsible, a good cook, and great with kids.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">Mel</div>
        <div class="text">Oh, that’s great. Thanks Grace. Can you give me her number? I’ll talk it over with Dan and give her a call tomorrow. Maybe this way I won’t be so tired every day, and Dan and I might even get to go on a date once in a while .</div>
