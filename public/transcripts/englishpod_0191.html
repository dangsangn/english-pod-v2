        <div class="text">Well, at the start of the spring we usually have more daylight in the mornings and less in the afternoon. This is basically due to our position on the planet and the rotation of the earth. In any case, to take better advantage of the daylight available, we compensate by moving our clocks forward one hour.</div>

        <div class="speaker">B</div>
        <div class="text">I see. That's convenient! I never understood things like this, such as GMT. I never know what time zone we are in or when to change my clock!</div>

        <div class="text">That just stands for Greenwich Mean Time. Here in California, we are in Pacific Standard Time, that is eight time zones west of Greenwich. Remember when we were in Beijing? Well, then we were in China Standard Time, and that's eight time zones east of Greenwich!</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">B</div>
        <div class="text">That's why it was so weird traveling from Beijing to LA! Because of the huge time difference, even though we left Beijing at noon and flew for more than eight hours, we still arrived in LA the same day at noon! It's like we went back in time!</div>
