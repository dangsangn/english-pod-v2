        <div class="text">That's where you're making a big mistake! You can't just guess peoples' likes or sizes! Especially with clothes or jewelry. On top of that, I think that you should get your mom something that shows how much you love her. Atthe same time you should show her that you took the time and effort tolook for something that she would really like!</div>
