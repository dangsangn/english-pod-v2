        <div class="text">So as I mentioned previously the campaign advertisement will focus on those key elements that every consumer looks for in a quality laptop:  affordability, quality, speed and reliability. We have pulled out all the stops to produce a product that really rivals all our competitors.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">Mr. Ford</div>
        <div class="text">Actually, just to illustrate my point let me give you an anecdote here. I remember last year I was playing golf with one of our key suppliers. It was a lovely summer afternoon. Anyway, I invited our supplier for a game of golf, and wanted to get his input on the new x420.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">Mr. Ford</div>
        <div class="text">Actually, I often get together with him for a good game of golf. It really is a wonderful way to relax. To be honest, I'm not that great at golf, but I have improved in the last few years.  But the key to golf is practice, practice, practice. I've lost my thread.  What was I talking about again?</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">Jonathan</div>
        <div class="text">I think you were discussing the campaign advertisement Michael.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">Mr. Ford</div>
        <div class="text">Yes, excuse me. I'm afraid I got side-tracked there. Yes anyway, the campaign. Well, erm. let me see.  Is the projector working yet Jonathan?</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">Jonathan</div>
        <div class="text">No sorry, IT are still fixing it.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">Mr. Ford</div>
        <div class="text">Ahh okay, erm... all the information on the campaign is on the PowerPoint. I haven't actually got my notes with me...ermlet me see, erm.....</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">Audience Member</div>
        <div class="text">Mr. Ford, could you at least tell us the schedule for the campaign? When are the first advertisements scheduled for?</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">Mr. Ford</div>
        <div class="text">That's a good question. Unfortunately I erm...don't have that information on me. I will have to get back to you on that point.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">Jonathan</div>
        <div class="text">Okay Michael, the projector is fixed. I think we're ready.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">Mr. Ford</div>
        <div class="text">Thank goodness.  Okay everyone, sorry for the delay. So without further ado the new x420 marketing campaign! Enjoy! oh ermmm. I'm terribly sorry, this is not the advert,  this is my golfing holiday in Barbados. I think I must have brought the wrong file. Can we take five?</div>
