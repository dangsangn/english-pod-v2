    <h1>Advanced - Job Interview I</h1>
    <div class="dialogue-block">
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">A</div>
        <div class="text">Okay,   so   let's   go over   everything  one more time.    I   really   want   you  to get   this  job!</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">B</div>
        <div class="text">I  know!    It's  an   amazing  growth opportunity!     They're   true   industry leaders,   and   it   would   be  so  interesting  to be  part of   an   organization  that   is   the  undisputed  leader  in   business process platform development.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">A</div>
        <div class="text">So,    let's see,    you  did   your   research  on   the   company,   right?</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">B</div>
        <div class="text">Well,    I   visited  their   website  and  read up  on   what   they   do.    They're an  IT service company   that   offers   comprehensive  business solutions    for   large   corporations.    They    provide   services  such as   CRM  development,    and   they  also   offer   custom-designed  applications.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">A</div>
        <div class="text">So     what   would   your   role   in    the    company?</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">B</div>
        <div class="text">Well,    the    position  is  for    an   account manager.     That   basically    means   that   I   would  be  the   link  between    our   and   our     development team.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">A</div>
        <div class="text">Sounds good,    and   so,    why  do   you   want   to work  with   them?</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">B</div>
        <div class="text">Well,    as I said  they're    the   industry leaders,   they   have   a   really     great   growth strategy,    amazing  development opportunities   for   employees,   and   it  seems like   they   have     strong    corporate governance.   They're   all about  helping  companies  grow  and     unleashing  potential.     I   guess   their   core values  and   mission  really   resonated  with   me.    Oh,    and   they   offer   six  weeks'   vacation,   stock options  and   bonuses... I'm   totally  going to cash in  on   that.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">A</div>
        <div class="text">You   idiot!    Don't   say  that!     Do  you   want  this  job,   or   not?</div>
    </div>
