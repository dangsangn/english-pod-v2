        <div class="text">Let's have a look. Hmmm. This doesn't look too good. I think we may have to pull out your wisdom tooth. It's pressing against your molars and that's one of the reasons you are experiencing so much pain.</div>

        <div class="text">First we will take some x-rays and see what we're dealing with. I also noticed a small cavity up front here, so you are going to need a filling.</div>

        <div class="speaker">A</div>
        <div class="text">It could be that, or maybe you are eating too many sweets. In any case, I'll administer an anesthetic and you won't feel a thing!</div>
