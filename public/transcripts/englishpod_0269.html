        <div class="text">Okay everyone, let’s begin. I called you here today to evaluate our marketing strategy during this recession. I wanted to re-emphasize our corporate mission  of Aiming to give our customers the best coffee and service in a clean and welcoming atmosphere.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">B</div>
        <div class="text">Several other shops have reduced the prices for their coffees and are drawing in more customers. Why aren’t we doing the same thing?</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">A</div>
        <div class="text">I know that recent sales have been slow, but we are not going to reduce our prices to  the level of our competitors. We offer a superior product and our focus is on long-term growth rather than short-term sales. If we lower our prices, we run the risk of devaluing our product.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">B</div>
        <div class="text">Customers don’t care about the coffee anymore. They only care about the price.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">A</div>
        <div class="text">I disagree. Highly discerning customers know that our coffee is far better than the coffee you buy at the other places. Our coffee bean  are artisan roasted and we use state-of-the-art equipment to brew our coffees. When you compare the coffees side-by-side our coffee wins the taste test every time. We have never sought to appeal to the mass market  with cheap coffee drinks, and we will not do so now.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">C</div>
        <div class="text">That’s true. We’ve certainly achieved top of mind awareness when it comes to the best best tasting  brews and it’s important to distinguish ourselves from our competitors. I think the main question is how we can show our appreciation to our customers.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">A</div>
        <div class="text">That’s the main question I would like to discuss today.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">B</div>
        <div class="text">Money is tight for everyone these days so even our most loyal customers may be reconsidering the money they pay for their morning coffee. Since the superiority of our coffee beans is one of our core competencies  why don’t we sell the beans for people to brew coffee at home.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">C</div>
        <div class="text">That could definitely be a way we could expand our company, but would we be undermining the essence of the company that way?</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">A</div>
        <div class="text">Let’s brainstorm some more ideas, and do some research. The customer always comes first, and what the customer wants, the customer gets. Maybe it’s time we started selling coffee beans.</div>
