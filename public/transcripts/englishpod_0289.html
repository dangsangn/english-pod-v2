        <div class="text">Okay, so if we could dim the lights Jonathan, we can kick-off with the first TV advert.  Please note that we are still in the early days with this advert, so it might seem a bit rough round the edges. Okay, so. just need to click this and the advert should pop up on the screen...</div>

        <div class="speaker">Mr. Ford</div>
        <div class="text">Hmmmmmm. Sorry about this. Bear with me me a second. There seems to be a problem with the projector. Let me see. could you lend a hand a second?</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">Jonathan</div>
        <div class="text">It looks like the projector is not recognizing the computer. Let me check the connection a second...  Well the connection seems okay, and the computer is running normally.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">Mr. Ford</div>
        <div class="text">Okay. Sorry guys. Obviously a problem with the system. Let's just reboot and start over.  Let's see if this resolves the issue.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">Jonathan</div>
        <div class="text">Right, lets try again. No, still nothing Michael. There might be a technical issue with the projector. I think maybe the projector has overheated. We might need to cool it down for ten minutes and start again. I'll call IT support to come over right now.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">Mr. Ford</div>
        <div class="text">Okay guys. Unfortunately technical problems do crop up from time to time, don't they? But it's not a huge problem. In the meantime while the IT guys get to work on that I can talk a little bit more about the advertising concept and what we are looking to achieve overall with this campaign.</div>
