        <div class="text">Let's start with the basics :bread. Bread is an important ingredient here. You need to remember one thing -choose the bread according to the following criteria :freshness, crumb and color. If you want a closed sandwich I recommend you first toast your bread in a toaster or oven, or grill it slightly until it gets a light brown color.</div>

        <div class="text">Now that our bread is ready, let's talk about the ingredients ! Of course, each person's palate is different, but I'm going to give you a few tips that you'll be able to use when turning any sandwich into the perfect sandwich.  I would strongly recommend you put fresh vegetables in your sandwich.</div>

        <div class="text">Do not undervalue them as they play a big role in forming the taste and will make the sandwich more refreshing and  light. The best choices here are evident- cucumbers, tomatoes, onions, sweet pepper pepper or chilli, lettuce and, of course, herbs- you can't go wrong with them. As for aubergines, mushrooms and asparagus, I would recommend you first grill them slightly with a little touch of olive oil.</div>

        <div class="text">Last but not least, we have a wide variety of condiments that we can add to our perfect sandwich.  We can be subtle and just add a touch of salt and pepper, or we can combine mustard sauce, mayonnaise, ketchup or even caviar to achieve a stronger flavor! It's always a good idea to cut your sandwich in triangles or manageable pieces to avoid all your ingredients falling out and staining your shirt!</div>
