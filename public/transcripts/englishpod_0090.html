One day, he was approached by members of the CIA, claiming that my father had made the discovery of the millennium in his small lab back at the university where   he taught bio-chemistry. I never saw him again. I vowed to discover the whereabouts of my father and consequently joined the Indian Intelligence Bureau.</div>
