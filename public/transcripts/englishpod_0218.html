        <div class="speaker">Jeff</div>
        <div class="text">Joanne, let’s not make this divorce any more acrimonious than it already is, okay? Let’s just get down to business and start dividing this stuff up fairly, so we can go our separate ways, alright?</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">Joanne</div>
        <div class="text">Fine with me. I just want to get this over with. It’s important we make a clean break. I should have signed a pre-nup.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">Jeff</div>
        <div class="text">What was that?</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">Joanne</div>
        <div class="text">Nothing! Anyway, you’re right, there’s no reason this has to be nasty. My lawyer tells me you’ve accepted our alimony proposal and the division of property, as well as the custody agreement- I keep the cat and you get the dog. So that’s done…. finally.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">Jeff</div>
        <div class="text">Let’s not go there, Joanne! Ok, so let’s start with the record collection, I’ll take the albums I contributed and you can have your cheesy disco albums  back.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">Joanne</div>
        <div class="text">Fine, but I’m keeping the antique gramophone as my grandfather gave it to me.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">Jeff</div>
        <div class="text">I believe that was a wedding present to both of us, Joanne. And you hardly ever use it!</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">Joanne</div>
        <div class="text">He’s my grandfather, and he never really liked you anyway!</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">Jeff</div>
        <div class="text">Whatever! Alright, I’ll concede the silly gramophone, if you’ll agree that I get the silver tea set.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">Joanne</div>
        <div class="text">How typical, when are you ever going to use a silver tea set? Fine! I don’t want to drag this out any longer than necessary. What’s next? What about these old photographs?</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">Jeff</div>
        <div class="text">Which ones? Let me have a look. Wow, look at that! That brings back memories…. That?</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">Joanne</div>
        <div class="text">Our trip to Italy! I remember that day. We were going to visit the Trevi fountain, and we got caught in the rain….</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">Jeff</div>
        <div class="text">… and you looked so adorable with your hair all wet. I had to take a picture of you standing there in that little alley, smiling and laughing in the rain….</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">Joanne</div>
        <div class="text">Oh, we really did have fun back then didn’t we?</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">Jeff</div>
        <div class="text">Oh, Joanne, are we making a big mistake? I know our relationship has been on the rocks for sometime but are you sure we can’t reconcile and try again? I still love you.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">Joanne</div>
        <div class="text">Oh Jeff! I love you too! I’m so glad we didn’t have to decide who keeps the motorcycle.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">Jeff</div>
        <div class="text">The motorcycle? But that’s mine!</div>
