        <div class="text">Alright, ladies and gentlemen.  We've been hired to build a deck on this here house, and turn this boring and drab lawn into a backyard oasis.   There is one catch, though. We've only got one day to finish this, so I'm gonna need everyone to give one hundred and ten percent today.  It's going to be tough, but we've got a great team here, and I know that together we can tackle this project.  That being said, let's get to work!</div>

        <div class="text">That's right.  Now, remember, we've been over the plans, but we really need to make sure that everything is up to code.    The home inspectors here are pretty thorough, so please make sure you follow the plans exactly.  And remember the carpenter's rule of thumb: measure twice and cut once.</div>
