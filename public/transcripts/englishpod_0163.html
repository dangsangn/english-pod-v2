        <div class="text">Well that was an interesting documentary!</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">B</div>
        <div class="text">For sure! I didn't really understand some ofthe technical jargon they used inthe film when they talked about social security in the US.</div>

    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">A</div>
        <div class="text">Like what?</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">B</div>
        <div class="text">Well, they mentioned how people put away money in something called a 401K?</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">A</div>
        <div class="text">Yeah, I know it sounds weird, but a 401k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement Through a  you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it inthe plan Everyone tries to contribute as much as possible  so that when you retire, you can rest peacefully on your nest egg.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">B</div>
        <div class="text">That's interesting and logical I guess. In my country, we also have to contribute to a government-run  retirement fund, but most people don't really trust itso they just invest in properties or things like that.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">A</div>
        <div class="text">That seems a bit unstable don't you think?</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">B</div>
        <div class="text">Yeah, but corrupt governments inthe past have created distrust among banks and financial institutions, so now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">A</div>
        <div class="text">I've been thinking of doing that lately! I don't want some banker to run off  with my money!</div>
