        <div class="speaker">A</div>
        <div class="text">Yes. I would like some information for requesting a loan.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">B</div>
        <div class="text">Very well, here arethe general termsof our loan policies. We pride ourselves in having the lowest interest rate inthe country for personal loans.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">A</div>
        <div class="text">I see. So let me get this straight. If I borrow let's say, ten thousand dollars, how much will I have to pay each month?</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">B</div>
        <div class="text">It depends on how long you take to pay it back. If we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for forty eight months, you would have to pay each month a portion ofthe loan which is called the principal and another small portion ofthe annual interest rate. This of course is considering that you don't default on a payment!</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">A</div>
        <div class="text">It sounds good but, there is just one problem. I have a terrible credit score.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">B</div>
        <div class="text">That is a very serious problem you see, the bank must assess your personal information, past loans, assets and any other relevant information such as your credit scorein order to approve your loan.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">A</div>
        <div class="text">You know what? I don't really need the money. Thanks anyways!</div>
