        <div class="text">Well, to begin with, Gambling is addictive, ruins marriages, destroys families and bankrupts communities.  Once you are addicted it is very difficult to stop.  People have lost their houses, cars and been left out on the street after becoming addicted.  Secondly, it exploits because men become addicted to gambling most often because of the action and risk. Women gamble to escape, and senior citizens will start gambling for the social interaction. Underage gamblers often start gambling on sports with friends and then illegal bookies.</div>

        <div class="text">You cannot predict who will become addicted to gambling. Now excuse me, I have a protest rally to organize!</div>
