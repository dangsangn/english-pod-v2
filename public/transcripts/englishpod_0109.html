        <div class="speaker">A</div>
        <div class="text">Honey, do you have a second?</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">B</div>
        <div class="text">Sure! Are you okay? You seem a bit worried. What's on your mind?</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">A</div>
        <div class="text">We need to talk.</div>
    </div>

        <div class="speaker">B</div>
        <div class="text">Okay...</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">A</div>
        <div class="text">I've been thinking, and well, I think we need to start seeing other people.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">B</div>
        <div class="text">What? Why? I mean, we've had our ups and downs, and we have the occasional disagreement, but we're happy together, aren't we?</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">A</div>
        <div class="text">That's just it,  I'm not happy anymore, Tim.  It's not you, it's me.  I know that I can be hard to deal with, and you are a great guy! You are the type of guy that any woman would kill for!</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">B</div>
        <div class="text">So, what are you saying? You're breaking up with me because I'm perfect?</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">A</div>
        <div class="text">Tim, you are too good for me.  You deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy.  Oh, I could say that I'll be all you need, but that would be a lie. I know I'd only hurt you,  I know I'd only make you cry.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">B</div>
        <div class="text">Baby, come on. Don't do this to me! Whatever it is, we can work it out.  Just give me another chance! I know that we can get through this, but we gotta stick together! Don't leave me.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">A</div>
        <div class="text">I can't, Tim. I hope someday you can find some way to understand I'm only doing this for you. I don't really wanna go but, deep in my heart I know this is the kindest thing to do.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">B</div>
        <div class="text">Laura...</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">A</div>
        <div class="text">Here are your keys. I'll send my sister to pick up the rest of my things next week.  I'm sorry, Tim. I wish you all the best, and I hope that one day we can meet again. I'll always love you. Goodbye.</div>
