    <h1>Global View - Capital Punishment</h1>
    <div class="dialogue-block">
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">Professor</div>
        <div class="text">That's all for today's class. We will continue our lecture on crime and punishment tomorrow.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">A</div>
        <div class="text">Do you think we should be tougher on crime?</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">B</div>
        <div class="text">Well, it depends on what you mean.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">A</div>
        <div class="text">For example, we could bring back the death penalty for murder, give longer prison sentences for lesser offences and lock up juvenile offenders.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">B</div>
        <div class="text">Those really sound like Draconian measures. Firstly, what do you do about miscarriages of justice if you've already put innocent people to death?</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">A</div>
        <div class="text">You'd only use capital punishment if you were absolutely sure that you'd convicted the right person.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">B</div>
        <div class="text">But, there've been many cases of wrongful conviction where people have been imprisoned for many years. The authorities were sure at the time, but later it was shown that the evidence was unreliable. In some cases, it'd been fabricated by the police.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">A</div>
        <div class="text">Well, no system of justice can be perfect, but surely there's a good case for longer prison sentences to deter serious crime.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">B</div>
        <div class="text">I doubt whether they could act as an effective deterrent while the detection rate is so low. The best way to prevent crime is to convince people who commit it that they're going to be caught. It doesn't make sense to divert all your resources into the prison system.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">A</div>
        <div class="text">But if you detect more crimes, you'll still need prisons. In my reckoning, if we could lock up more juvenile criminals, they'd learn that they couldn't get away with it. Soft sentences will merely encourage them to do it again.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">B</div>
        <div class="text">Yes, but remember that prisons are often schools for criminals. To remove crime from society, you really have to tackle its causes.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">A</div>
        <div class="text">Well,  if I were president, I would impose tougher laws and punishment. I would have a peaceful society based on fear of punishment, not consciousness of doing the right thing.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">B</div>
        <div class="text">You sound like a dictator!</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">A</div>
        <div class="text">Well if it works, why not?</div>
    </div>
