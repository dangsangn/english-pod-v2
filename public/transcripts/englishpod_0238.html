        <div class="text">Now, Miss Childs passed on your resume to me and I've had the chance to look it over and I must say I'm quite impressed.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">Rebecca</div>
        <div class="text">Thank you very much. I've tried to keep it short and clear. If there's any questions please feel free to ask me.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">Mr. Parsons</div>
        <div class="text">Well yes, I do have a number of questions, but perhaps first you could give me a brief overview I'd like to get a little bit of an idea of your background.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">Rebecca</div>
        <div class="text">yes of course. Well as you can see from the resume I'm up and grew up in Brooklyn, New York, although our family moved to London when I was quite young, at around rook.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">Mr. Parsons</div>
        <div class="text">Ah I see, so you were actually educated in Europe?</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">Rebecca</div>
        <div class="text">yes precisely. Although I was born in the US, I would definitely call London home. But as you see I've actually spent a lot of my life moving from country to country. My Father was inthe oil business before he retired so we also spent a number of years in Saudi Arabia too.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">Mr. Parsons</div>
        <div class="text">Very interesting. So it seems you had quite an adventurous childhood.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">Rebecca</div>
        <div class="text">Absolutely! We were never still for too long. But now I'm really looking to settle down.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">Mr. Parsons</div>
        <div class="text">I see. Okay, well let's move on to discuss your education shall we?</div>
    </div>
    <div class="line">
        <div class="speaker">Rebecca</div>
        <div class="text">Sure.</div>
